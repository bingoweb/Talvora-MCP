# Talvora architecture

Talvora intentionally starts from a clean design.

## Runtime

`Talvora.exe` is a self-contained ASP.NET Core application installed as the Windows service `Talvora` under `LocalSystem`. It listens only on loopback port 7676 and maps MCP at `/mcp` using the official C# MCP SDK's stateless HTTP transport.

There is no user-session gateway, named-pipe broker, compatibility shim, legacy maintenance layer, or secondary privileged process.

## Capability model

The service account is the capability boundary. Talvora does not implement command deny-lists or filesystem allow-lists for its primitive capability surface. Six primitive tools expose system information, filesystem read/write/delete/list, and arbitrary executable execution. Higher-level Windows capabilities are composed from these primitives until a dedicated tool materially improves reliability or ergonomics.

The read-only knowledge layer is separate from that capability boundary. `search` and `fetch` provide structured document discovery/retrieval for ChatGPT knowledge workflows without reducing the privileges or addressable paths of the primitive tools.

## Knowledge retrieval

`search(query)` returns structured search results containing `id`, `title`, `text`, and `url`. `fetch(id)` accepts a search result ID and returns the complete text plus metadata.

By default, search walks knowledge-oriented locations rather than crawling the whole machine: Public Documents, each local user's Documents/Desktop/Downloads/OneDrive folders, and `%ProgramData%\Talvora`. The machine environment variable `TALVORA_KNOWLEDGE_ROOTS` replaces those roots when an explicit corpus is desired.

The local scan skips reparse-point directory recursion, ignores inaccessible files/directories, searches text-oriented files up to 4 MiB each, caps a response at 20 results, and uses an internal time budget so an oversized corpus returns partial results rather than holding the MCP request indefinitely. These are retrieval-engine constraints only; they are not filesystem or execution restrictions on Talvora's primitive tools.

## Installation

The reset installer deletes prior Talvora Windows services, scheduled tasks, known Talvora runtime processes, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Talvora`, `%PROGRAMDATA%\Talvora`, and the previous source checkout. It then clones a clean `main`, publishes a self-contained `win-x64` service, installs it as LocalSystem, verifies health and SID `S-1-5-18`, runs the real MCP smoke suite, and writes the `talvora_local` client registration.

Chocolatey is the only package manager used. WinGet is not used.

The local runtime does not require an OpenAI API account, API key, public ingress, or tunnel. Remote publication to ChatGPT web is a separate deployment concern from the Windows-local Talvora runtime.
